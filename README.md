# Stanford Research Computing Script Library

This is a repository containing scripts that can be used (with light editing) with Stanford's Sherlock cluster. 

Most scripts are aimed at quantitative work in the humanities. If the process you are looking for is not here, feel free to reach out either here or at [bcritt@stanford.edu](mailto:bcritt@stanford.edu). We're always looking to expand our offerings and only really know what's needed when people tell us!

Please also note that our environments are constantly evolving, so some scripts may cease working over time. It's usually an easy fix for someone familiar with the systems, so again, reach out if you're having issues.
